# geoscience-modeling

Contains all of my MATLAB (.m) scripts for the computer modeling course GEOL5700 with Bob Anderson and Greg Tucker. Download the whole zip for all inclusive data files. 

Models are listed in temporal order and numbered. This repo contains 11 models, with various sub-models within each numbered file.

Model 1  -- thermal diffusion
Model 2  -- thermal diffusion continued
Model 3  -- simple coral reef growth
Model 4  -- hillslope diffusion and faulting
Model 5  -- glacial reconstructions
Model 6  -- horton overland flow
Model 7  -- landlab glacier attempt
Model 8  -- thermal optimization (model 2)
Model 9  -- 1d ripple organization
Model 10 -- lattice-boltzmann 2d flow
Model 11 -- eustatic/tectonic coral reef growth
